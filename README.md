### Update your DB

If you install the project locally, at the first login you will see a button to update your database with the data from the Api. The platform A, will be the master, meaning that if you have 2 fields, with the same key but different values, only the one one platform A will be considered.

![Edit Info](documentation/images/form.png)

As soon as you submit by clicking on the button, you will wait until the informations on api are stored too.

## Warning 
You may edit hours for each day of the week individaully or you can do so from the hours field. Keep in mind that if you have your hours field with values, as soon ass you change a day of the week, the data will be erased and you need to select hours for all days of the week.

## Warning - External Problems.
When you use this app it is possible, that for some reason one or more platforms are down. You can still edit your database, if the app can not save the results on the platforms it will wait and try again multiple times.If by the end of the defined time, still is not possible, it will save the info on a stack and try again later so that you don't have to insert all information again.
